0.02  o Bugfix to permute() method, reported by Marc Logghe.
      o Combinations/Permutations now calculated using iterator.
        Uses less memory for very large sets (David Coppit, Tye,
        Christopher Eltschka).

0.03  o Added reference to Set::Scalar, Set::Bag
      o new() accepts a 'compare' option.

        bug when using a set of references, identified by Ying Yang
        <yyang@emba.uvm.edu>.

0.06  o Added multiset, string, and derangement methods for OO mode
      o Corrections to documentation examples

0.09  o Optimized re-implemention of derange() by Carlos Rica
        <carlos@red-libertaria.net>
